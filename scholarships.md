## College of Education Student Scholarship

Recognizing the academic, professional, and personal value of study abroad experiences
The College strongly encourages its students to study abroad, and provides financial support through scholarships or program discounts of $500 (depending on available funds) that are awarded to defray the costs associated with studying abroad on University of Illinois sponsored programs.

### Eligibility
Scholarship recipients must be degree-seeking students in good academic standing who are currently enrolled in an eligible education program at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Eligible programs include undergraduate Early Childhood, Elementary, and Special Education, and Secondary Education programs in Biology, Chemistry, Earth Science, English, Math, Physics and Social Studies (History), Learning and Education Studies, as well as all graduate programs in all College of Education departments.

All eligible students who are admitted to, and enrolled in, a University of Illinois sponsored study abroad program will be awarded the Study Abroad Scholarship. This scholarship is repeatable for subsequent study abroad experiences. However, students may not receive more than one scholarship per academic year + summer (August to August).

## Financial Aid
Because this program is sponsored by the University of Illinois, financial aid can be applied to the cost of the program. The amount of financial aid that is applicable to your program will depend on your financial aid package. Because there are many variables that determine your financial aid package, it is best that you consult with a financial aid advisor in the [Office of Student Financial Aid](https://www.osfa.illinois.edu/) to discuss your individual financial aid package. 

Upon admission to a program, you will be provided with a financial aid budget form to submit to the Office of Student Financial Aid.

*If you are a non-Illinois student, please contact the [Illinois Program Coordinator](mailto:jminni3@illinois.edu) or the [Office of International Programs](mailto:international@education.illinois.edu) for assistance in applying for financial aid through your own institution.
