## Financial Aid
Because this program is sponsored by the University of Illinois, financial aid can be applied to the cost of the program. The amount of financial aid that is applicable to your program will depend on your financial aid package. Because there are many variables that determine your financial aid package, it is best that you consult with a financial aid advisor in the [Office of Student Financial Aid](https://www.osfa.illinois.edu/) to discuss your individual financial aid package. 

Upon admission to a program, you will be provided with a financial aid budget form to submit to the Office of Student Financial Aid.

*If you are a non-Illinois student, please contact the [Illinois Program Coordinator](mailto:jminni3@illinois.edu) or the [Office of International Programs](mailto:international@education.illinois.edu) for assistance in applying for financial aid through your own institution.
