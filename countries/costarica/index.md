## Spring Break in Costa Rica: Preparing Schools for a Changing Environment

During this Spring Break study abroad opportunity, students will work in local schools and live with families in San Joaquin de Flores. We will also stay overnight in Guanacaste for a agroecological immersion learning experience, visit a coffee and cocoa plantation, and work with local students on themes and strategies related to environmental education. 

## Instituto San Joaquin

The Instituto San Joaquin de Flores was started by two University of Illinois ACES alumni and offers study abroad programs for students and visitors to Costa Rica. We have partnered with the Institute to create custom Spring Break programs geared towards education students with a focus on environmental topics in education. Each program is coordinated by staff at Instituto San Joaquin. 

The Institute is housed in a colonial-style building constructed specifically to be an academic facility and language school. Its two-story structure houses classrooms, lounges and study spaces on each floor, as well as bathrooms and a pantry. It has lovely gardens with orchids and other tropical plants, and two large mango trees. 

## Location: San Joaquin de Flores, Costa Rica

San Joaquin is a small town in the Heredia Province of Costa Rica, close to the Poas and Irazu volcanos. The town is known for its church, Iglesia San Joaquin, that was built in 1880, and is home to Instituto San Joaquin de Flores, which was founded by two University of Illinois alumni. The Institute hosts many study abroad programs for the University of Illinois, and is one of our esteemed international partners. 

Costa Rica is a small country, and many areas are a short distance driving from one another. On study abroad programs to San Joaquin, transport to other areas of the country is provided.

<div id="housing">

Housing for this program will be on-site cabins during the overnight agroecological tour, and homestays in San Joaquin. We believe that many of the valuable experiences are formed outside of the classroom. By staying with a host family that best matches your criteria, you will immerse yourself in Costa Rican life through day to day interaction. All of the host families went through careful screening and selection by our resident director at Instituto San Joaquin, and they all have been hosting students from the U.S. for over ten years.
