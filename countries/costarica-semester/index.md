## Spend your Semester in Costa Rica!

Spend your semester studying Spanish language courses while also taking classes on education practices in Latin America with a focus on Costa Rica.   

This program will be centered at the San Joaquin Institute, founded by University of Illinois Alumni for the purpose of educating American students on the language and culture of Costa Rica. Just outside of San Jose in the province of Heredia, you will live near the Instituto and work within local schools.

### College of Education staff will assist students with:

* Pre-departure: an introduction to global comparative education and French schooling in an online pre-departure class. Learn the customs, practices, and policies of the French education system.
* Visa process
* Financial planning and budgeting
* Life abroad - tips for enjoying Costa Rica

## Instituto San Joaquin de Flores

The Instituto San Joaquin de Flores offers two types of study abroad programs for students and visitors to Costa Rica: Semester and Summer-long academic programs and short-term Spanish language courses for beginners and up. 

The Institute is housed in a colonial-style building constructed specifically to be an academic facility and language school. Its two-story structure houses classrooms, lounges and study spaces on each floor, as well as bathrooms and a pantry. It has lovely gardens with orchids and other tropical plants, and two large mango trees. 

All courses at the Institute are taught by faculty from the Universidad de Costa Rica (UCR) and the Universidad Nacional (UNA) de Costa Rica. Some of the courses have been created in cooperation with the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

San Joaquin is a small town in the Heredia Province of Costa Rica, close to the Poas and Irazu volcanos. The town is known for its church, Iglesia San Joaquin, that was built in 1880, and is home to Instituto San Joaquin de Flores, which was founded by two University of Illinois alumni. The Institute hosts many study abroad programs for the University of Illinois, and is one of our esteemed international partners. 

Costa Rica is famous for pristine beaches, rainforest, waterfalls and volcanoes, but did you know it has one of the highest ranked education systems in Latin America? Costa Rican schools have developed numerous innovative practices for teaching sustainability and care for the environment.   You will have the opportunity to tour the stunning landscape of Costa Rica while learning how schools and communities teach their children to respect and care for the local environment as a national treasure. 

Costa Rica is a small country, and many areas are a short distance driving from one another. On study abroad programs to San Joaquin, transport to other areas of the country is provided.

<div id="housing">

Housing for this program will be homestays in San Joaquin. We believe that many of the valuable experiences are formed outside of the classroom. By staying with a host family that best matches your criteria, you will immerse yourself in Costa Rican life through day to day interaction. All of the host families went through careful screening and selection by our resident director at Instituto San Joaquin, and they all have been hosting students from the U.S. for over ten years.
