## Education Abroad in Greece: The Roots of Citizenship and Identity

Athens & Thessaloniki, Greece

Greece has always been the place educators and scholars considered to understand ideas about citizenship. This continues to be true as ancient ideas bump up against global mobility. Study modern Greece in the European Union context and work directly with children in the refugee camps who live out global struggles to understand citizenship in a global era. We will visit Athens and Thessaloniki in Greece, as well as a 2-3 day excursion in Rome, Italy. 

Program Objectives:

1. Understand the roots and legacy of many cultural concepts (i.e., systems of laws and government, architecture, literature, and language) that are important still today.
2. Learn from the past: Explore and examine the how citizenship psychological roots (i.e., Rome, Greeks) had strong ties to common cultures and often viewed as superior (how can this be viewed today)
3. Looking forward: Understand and discuss how citizenship and identity does not have to diminish globalization but can highlight the strength behind identity, intersectionality, community, and cultural ties in a global village.
4. Bring it to the classroom
   * Explore how the ideas of citizenship are reflected in Greek classrooms of public and private schools
      * Nationally governed education system with the same rules applied in all the schools of the country
   * In contrast, explore how multiculturalism is present in Greek classrooms, how it is addressed and integrated as part of the school society and the general community
