Plus, a weekend trip to Cape Town, South Africa is included!

The award is intended to increase the number of students with global competencies and in-depth understandings of other countries and cultures. Illinois students may achieve this advance in understanding by studying abroad and holding internships in the developing world, particularly in countries in Africa, Latin America, and Asia that historically have been underrepresented in study abroad.
