Verona is a city in northern Italy's Veneto region. It contains a small medieval town in its center, and is famously known as the location of Shakespeare's "Romeo and Juliet." It is the third largest city in Italy, with a population of 257,276, and is home to an ancient Roman amphitheater - the Verona Arena.

<div id="housing">

We believe that many of the valuable experiences that you will have in Verona are formed outside of the classroom. By staying with a host family that best matches your criteria, you will immerse yourself in the Italian life through day to day interaction. Your host family might also invite you for a weekend getaway to their lakeshore cabin or joining them for a school event with their kids, or visit a local charity event or sporting event. All the host families went through careful screening and selection by our Verona resident director and they all have been hosting students from the U.S. for over ten years. Our Verona resident director is always just a phone call away to assist you.
