The city of Verona, ranked as the second safest city in Italy, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site that immerses students in a vibrant mix of tradition and innovation that defines the Veronese culture. With renowned music festivals, a breathtaking Roman amphitheater, the romantic backdrop of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, a proud culinary culture and a leading global wine market, Verona is considered a hidden gem by our students. Nestled along the Adige River and surrounded by Lake Garcia, the Valpolicella Valley and the Italian Alps, it is the perfect place to study while enjoying river rafting, days at the lake, medieval castle hikes, cooking with local artisans and winery visits.

<div id="housing">

We believe that many of the valuable experiences that you will have in Verona are formed outside of the classroom. By staying with a host family that best matches your criteria, you will immerse yourself in the Italian life through day to day interaction. Your host family might also invite you for a weekend getaway to their lakeshore cabin or joining them for a school event with their kids, or visit a local charity event or sporting event. All the host families went through careful screening and selection by our Verona resident director and they all have been hosting students from the U.S. for over ten years. Our Verona resident director is always just a phone call away to assist you.
