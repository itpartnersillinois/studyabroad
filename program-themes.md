## Program Themes
Join a program designed specifically for Education majors to enhance your own global competency. While each of the programs is suitable for studying any focus within education, the following themes can guide participants in choosing locations of particular relevance based on areas of interest. Embedded within each program are opportunities to study issues of diversity, social and economic justice, and best practices in education. 

### Citizenship in a Global Era
