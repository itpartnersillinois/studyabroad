## Study Abroad with COE
Education abroad is a powerful step towards building your own familiarity with other cultures, improving your own teaching practice, and developing your own global network of colleagues that can support you as a teacher.

### Research-Based And Education-Driven Curricula
The University of Illinois College of Education has designed programs for education majors that are research-based, education curriculum driven, and train you to translate your education abroad experience into skills you need to teach future generations in our diverse global society.

### Enhance Your Global Competency
Illinois Education Abroad programs are designed to enhance your own global competency so that you can teach those skills to your students:

* Work with Education faculty before departure to learn about your host site
* Meet local Education faculty at the host university institution
* Study languages at any level, but also study Education
* Join classes and activities with Education students from the US and from your host institution
* Observe classrooms in the host country
* Spend time in placements with students from your target age group within local PreK-12 classrooms
