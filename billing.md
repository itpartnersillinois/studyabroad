### Official Program Budget (or Financial Aid Budget)
After acceptance into a program but before required commitment, we will upload your official budget into My Study Abroad. This document is very similar to the unofficial budget that was viewed on the Program Costs page, except this budget has the official program costs. These are the amounts that will be billed to your student account and will also be used by the Office of Student Financial Aid (OSFA) in creating your study abroad financial aid packages. Review budgets carefully before committing to the program. Once you commit, you may be liable for the program costs. See the withdrawal policy for more information.

### Confirmation of Participation
After acceptance into a program, your Education Abroad Coordinator will upload a confirmation of participation (CoP) into your My Study Abroad account. The top section of the document will be identical to the official budget but the bottom has a contract agreement section, a signature section, and a policy section. You must print, sign, scan and upload the completed CoP into your My Study Abroad account. Students cannot participate in the program if this step is not completed. If you fail to submit the CoP by the program commitment deadline, you will be withdrawn from the program.
